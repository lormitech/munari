# Munari

**Munari** is a software suite to carry out multifractal analysis of computed tomography (CT) images of 2D/3D complex structures.

One of the main calculations is the direct evaluation of the singularity
spectrum f(alpha) by using the Chhabra method.
At this stage, the application processes grayscale images in ASCII format.

The core module is implemented in C++. The front-end is implemented in R.
